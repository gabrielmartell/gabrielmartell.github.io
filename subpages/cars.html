			<h4 id="about_me_text2"> I was never really into the car scene until I got my first car, which was a Honda Civic 2022. It was my first ever car, and I've drove it around for a good year. Again, I was never into cars - but my dad is. He always said my car wasn't sporty enough - and that made me infuriated. However, being the bigger person and not letting his words get to me, I then traded in my car for a Subaru WRX 2023 to simply prove him wrong. Jokes aside, I always wanted to get a considerably-fast car, as I've always been a fan of car media in both video games (Need for Speed) and movies (Fast and Furious). This transition became an eye-opener to something I really enjoy in my day-to-day. Countless sweat, money and time spent on manual labour and watching youtube tutorials, and even the car itself, allowed me to work on MY car, MY way - and it was worth every bit of it.

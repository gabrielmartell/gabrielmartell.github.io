				<div class="desc"> The COMP3005 Autograder was a tool for student submissions of Project v1 of the Carleton University COMP3005 Winter 2024 Class. It was an automated system that would parse through each student's github repository submission, read their database dump file to fabricate a new database, and records the query metrics to determine correctness and efficiency - created on a Linux environment. The autograder itself is currently private to withold Academic Integrity, but the submission script template and further information for students can be found on the image's hyperlink.</div>
